![M]({{ site.baseur }}/images/michal.jpg)

If you have difficulty saying my name (and many people have) then you should know that:

Micha≈Ç in English is Michael, so simply say or write Michael.

Derkacz in Latin is [Crex Crex](https://www.google.com/search?q=Derkacz&tbm=isch), in English is [Corn Crake](https://www.google.com/search?q=Derkacz&tbm=isch), but rather don't write Michael Corn Crake as my name :) Michael Derkacz is acceptable.
